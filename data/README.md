# `data/`

### Notes
1. The PC members list is generated automaticaly from the `.jsonl` file saved here
2. That file is generated by processing the `.csv` file saved here by running `script/generate_confirmed_pc_file.py`.
3. The `.jsonl` version is a "cleaned" version that includes only the "confirmed" PC members as detailed in the `.csv` file.
